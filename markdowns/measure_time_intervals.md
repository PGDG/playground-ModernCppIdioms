# Measure Time Intervals
C++11 provides a flexible date and time library as part of the standard library that allows to define time points and time intervals. The library is called [`chrono`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono) and is available in the `<chrono>` header in the `std::chrono` namespace.
