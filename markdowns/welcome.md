# Welcome!

Welcome to the _"Modern C++" idoms and recipes_ workshop by the
[C++ Usergroup Zentralschweiz](http://cpp-ug-luzern.blogspot.de/)

# Introduction
In this workshop we will look at some common idioms and recipes for C++
programming with the focus on _"Modern C++"_ implementations, i.e.
implementations that use features of the new C++ standards C++11/14 and soon 17.

Some of the ideas for the recipes are taken from the book
[_"Modern C++ Programming Cookbook"_](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/modern-c-programming-cookbook)
by Marius Bancila

# DIY (Do It Yourself)
The following pages contain introductory examples and small exercise.

If you want to use the C++17 features presented outside of the tech.io
environment, you need a recent compiler which supports the C++17
features used, e.g. gcc 7.1.
