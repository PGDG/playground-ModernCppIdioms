# Welcome!

Welcome for the _"Modern C++" idoms and recipes_ workshop by the
[C++ Usergroup Zentralschweiz](http://cpp-ug-luzern.blogspot.de/)

# Introduction
In this workshop will look at some common idioms and recipes for C++
programming with focus on _"Modern C++"_ implementation, i.e.
implementations that use features of the new C++ standards C++11/14 and soon 17.

The ideas for the recipes are mainly taken from the book
[_"Modern C++ Programming Cookbook"_](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/modern-c-programming-cookbook)
by Marius Bancila

# DIY (Do It Yourself)
The following pages contain some introduction examples and then code you need
to refactor or complete.

If you want to use the C++17 features presented outside of the tech.io (this) environment on
your own computer, you need a recent compiler which supports the C++17
features used, e.g. gcc 7.1.
